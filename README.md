Ultrasonic detection and deep learning for high-precision concrete strength prediction
Concrete compressive strength is a critical factor affecting the load-bearing capacity of concrete structures. However, current non-destructive testing for evaluating the concrete strength of in-service structures continues to encounter challenges in terms of accuracy, reliability, and applicability. This study proposes a completely new technological approach, utilizing ultrasonic detection and deep learning techniques. First, standard concrete specimens were prepared for testing, and both compressive strength and ultrasonic tests were performed, leading to the creation of an ultrasonic database with 623 metadata entries. Secondly, a hybrid model combining deep learning and machine learning was developed to predict concrete compressive strength, with the ultrasonic database fed as input for model training. Finally, the performance of the hybrid model was further enhanced through the integration of hyperparameters, as identified by SHapley Additive exPlanations algorithms. The optimal model showed a substantial improvement in precision, reducing the mean absolute error to 2.02 MPa and the mean absolute percentage error to 7.84%. This research highlights the significant potential of utilizing ultrasonic detection and deep learning, and introduces a novel non-destructive testing method for assessing the strength of in-service structures.
